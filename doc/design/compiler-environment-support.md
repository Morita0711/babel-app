# Compiler environment support

The Babel compiler is **only** supported in these environments:

 - Modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge etc.
 - Node 0.10+

This means that notably Babel does not support the following environments:

 - Rhino
 - Nashorn
 - Internet Explorer
 - ...

**NOTE:** Compiler support does not dictate the runtime requirements of compiled code.
